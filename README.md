## 4. Knowledge Base (Sample Q&A)
**15 AI Concept Q&A Pairs**

1. **Q:** What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?  
   **A:** AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think, learn, and make decisions.

2. **Q:** What is Machine Learning (ML)?  
   **A:** ML is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

3. **Q:** What is Deep Learning?  
   **A:** Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyse complex patterns in data.

4. **Q:** What is a Neural Network?  
   **A:** A neural network is a set of algorithms modeled after the human brain used in machine learning to recognize patterns.

5. **Q:** What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?  
   **A:** NLP is the field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

6. **Q:** What is Computer Vision?  
   **A:** Computer vision enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual input like images or videos.

7. **Q:** What is Supervised Learning?  
   **A:** Supervised learning is a machine learning method where the model is trained on labeled data.

8. **Q:** What is Unsupervised Learning?  
   **A:** Unsupervised learning is where the model learns from data without labeled outputs, discovering hidden patterns or structures.

9. **Q:** What is Reinforcement Learning?  
   **A:** It's a type of learning where an AI agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

10. **Q:** What is Bias in AI?  
    **A:** Bias in AI occurs when data or algorithms produce unfair outcomes, often reflecting social or historical inequalities.

11. **Q:** What is Algorithmic Bias?  
    **A:** Bias that arises when an AI system makes discriminatory or prejudiced decisions due to biased data or logic.

12. **Q:** What is the Turing Test?  
    **A:** The Turing Test evaluates a machineâ€™s ability to exhibit human-like intelligence through conversation.

13. **Q:** What are the main ethical issues in AI?  
    **A:** Ethical concerns include bias, privacy violations, job displacement, accountability, and misuse of AI technologies.

14. **Q:** What is Explainable AI (XAI)?  
    **A:** XAI refers to AI systems designed to explain their decisions in a way humans can understand.

15. **Q:** What are real-world applications of AI?  
    **A:** AI is used in healthcare, finance, self-driving cars, customer service (chatbots), facial recognition, and more.
